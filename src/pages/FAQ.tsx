    question: "Is this as big of a deal as some people say?",

      <p key={shortid.generate()} className={styles.questionAnswer}>
        Coronavirus is a major public health concern for the world. With more
        people needing medical attention and hospitalisation, there is a major
        strain on healthcare infrastructure. Resources are limited and the
        broader the spread of the virus, the bigger the consequence on
        everyone's individual healthcare. In addition, the disease can pose a
        serious risk to anyone who becomes infected. While the fatality rate of
        the disease depends upon a variety of factors, for coronavirus
        (COVID-19) this may be somewhere between 1-5%.

    question: "Should I wash my hands with soap or use hand sanitiser?",
    answerParagraphs: [
      <p key={shortid.generate()} className={styles.questionAnswer}>
        Washing your hands with soap for at least 20 seconds is the best way to
        avoid the virus. Soap breaks down the virus, and lubricates the virus
        away from the skin. If soap is not available, using an alcohol-based
        sanitiser gel is your next best option - ensure that every corner of
        your hands are soaked with the gel. Any sanitiser gel you use should be
        at least 60% alcohol.

        The disease most likely spreads through small droplets that are released
        when someone with coronavirus coughs or exhales. These droplets can then
        land directly on someone else. Droplets can also be on surfaces; when
        someone touches a surface with droplets and then touches their face,
        they can also get coronavirus. You should clean surfaces with a
        disinfectant and wash your hands with soap regularly. More research is
        being done on the spread of the disease.
