        Antenatal appointments are very important to ensure your pregnancy is

        you must contact your maternity unit before and inform them. If you have
        any urgent problem, please contact the emergency contact details you
        have been provided. If you do not have any emergency contact details,
        please contact your GP, midwife, or NHS 111.

        Most likely your labour will be in an obstetric unit with extra

        coming to the hospital and you have symptoms, you should travel by
        private transport if you can or call 111/999 if necessary. It is likely
        you will be met outside the hospital by the maternity unit, fitted with
        a mask, and tested for coronavirus. While your birth partner(s) will be
        able to stay with you, it is likely that other visitors will be limited.
        If you think you have the symptoms of coronavirus and you are near your
        due date, you should call your maternity unit and inform them.

        The current UK guidance is that if your baby is well and doesn’t require

        would like. However, the specific risks and benefits will be discussed
        with you by your doctor at the time.
