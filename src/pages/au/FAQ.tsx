    question: "Whats the difference between coronavirus and COVID-19?",
    answerParagraphs: [
      <p key={shortid.generate()} className={styles.questionAnswer}>
        Coronavirus refers to a large family of viruses. COVID-19 is the disease
        caused by the specific coronavirus currently spreading across the world.
        For simplicity, we use the terms interchangeably on this website.

    question: "How is coronavirus spread?",
    answerParagraphs: [
      <p key={shortid.generate()} className={styles.questionAnswer}>
        The disease most likely spreads through small droplets that are released
        when someone with coronavirus coughs or exhales. These droplets can then
        land directly on someone else. Droplets can also be on surfaces; when
        someone touches a surface with droplets and then touches their face,
        they can also get coronavirus. You should clean surfaces with a
        disinfectant and wash your hands with soap regularly. More research is
        being done on the spread of the disease.

        It is estimated that a person would usually develop the symptoms within
        1 to 14 days after catching coronavirus. This is known as incubation
        period, these estimates are being researched continously and will be
        updated as more information is available.

        Coronavirus is a major public health concern for the world. With more
        people needing medical attention and hospitalisation, there is a major
        strain on healthcare infrastructure. Resources are limited and the
        broader the spread of the virus, the bigger the consequence on
        everyone's individual healthcare. While most people have mild symptoms,
        approximately 15% of people have severe infections and 5% require
        intensive care in a hospital ICU. The proportions of severe and critical
        COVID-19 infections are higher than for influenza infections.

        "Although it is possible for an infected person to spread the virus
        before the symptoms appear, the risk is very low. The main way for the
        virus to spread is through droplets when an infected person coughs or

        Many infected people experience only mild symptoms, especially in the

        Generally, paracetamol is preferred for temperatures/coughs/sore throat.

        guidance suggests taking either paracetamol or ibuprofen. Paracetamol is
