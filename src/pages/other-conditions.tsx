    answerParagraphs: [
      <p key={shortid.generate()} className={questionStyles.questionAnswer}>
        If you have HIV/AIDS and have no detectable viral load and a normal CD4
        count, there is no evidence that indicates you are at a higher risk of
        being infected or becoming very unwell. However, if you have a low CD4
        count or do not take your medication as prescribed, you may be at higher
        risk. You should speak to your HIV consultant about any concerns you may
        have. If you have any additional medical condition (e.g. diabetes, any
        heart or lung condition), you are at a higher risk and should take extra
        caution by strictly following the above advice from the NHS and Public
        Health England. If you just started HIV treatment, you should speak to
        your HIV consultant about your specific risk.
      </p>,
      <p key={shortid.generate()} className={questionStyles.questionAnswer}>
        You should take your HIV medication as prescribed. Do not increase the
        number of tablets you take. In addition, do not share your medication
        with anyone who has coronavirus, or is worried about getting it. HIV
        medication will not prevent you from getting coronavirus. If you think
        you are ill with coronavirus, you should continue taking your HIV
        medication. If you have any worries or concerns, you should contact{" "}

        foreign travel.
