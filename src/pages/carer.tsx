        You should follow the NHS and Public Health England self-isolation
        guidance as found here. Inform your employer immediately of your
        situation, and do not go back to caring until your self-isolation has
        ended. It can be very dangerous if you have symptoms and still care for
        someone.

        1 - Use personal protective equipment (PPE) every time you are in close

        if there is a risk of splashing You must use new PPE for each time you

    answerParagraphs: [

        Find out if the person you are caring for is properly self-isolating
        from the person who is ill. This means not sharing a bathroom, not
        sharing a bedroom, and keeping 2m at all times from the person who is
        ill.

        If the person you are caring for has been in contact with the person who

        should care for them as if they had the symptoms of coronavirus. This
        means: - Using PPE (aprons, gloves, masks, eye protection if necessary)
        - Cleaning frequently touched surfaces with disinfectants - Taking extra
        caution by washing your hands regularly, avoiding touching your face,
        and keeping as much distance as possible

        in your normal waste bin.

        If you're caring for someone with the symptoms of coronavirus, you
        should wash clothing with laundry detergent at a high temperature
        setting. Do not shake laundry before washing, as this can help spread
        the virus.

        If there is no laundry machine on site, you should leave laundry in a
        bag and wait for 72 hours. After this, you can do the laundry in a
        public laundromat.
